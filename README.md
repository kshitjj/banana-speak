# Minion Translator
 I have always wondered, that if I find a minion out in the wild? how would I communicate with him. So, To solve that problem of mine. I build a minion translator, Which does exactly what it says. it translates english into minion language. So, next time we run into a minion, we are able to talk with him.\
